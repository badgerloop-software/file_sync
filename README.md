# Driver IO to Engineering Dashboard File Sync Utility
This program synchronizes files generated by a [driver IO](https://github.com/badgerloop-software/sc1-driver-io) background process with a server, and from the server onto the machine running the [engineering dashboard](https://github.com/badgerloop-software/chase-car-dashboard).

## Libraries
* [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html): Library for HTTP; used on all components
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com): Library for building APIs; used on server only
* [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/): Library for data validation and type checking; currently used on server only

## Running & Contributing
1. Use [pip to install libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html). If you prefer, you may also use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html) to isolate this project's dependencies from other Python packages on your computer.
2. Run the main.py files in each of the top-level directories of this repository. You can run all three components on your computer at the same time if you want to test the system end to end.
